Prerequisites
To get this project up and running on your local machine, you need to have the following software installed:

JDK (Java Development Kit): Version 8 or higher.

Apache Tomcat Server: Version 8.5 or higher.

MySQL Server: Version 5.7 or higher.

NetBeans IDE: Version 8.2 or higher.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Clone the Repository

git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-project-folder]

Database Setup

Open MySQL and create a new database:
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;

Locate the database.sql file in the project directory. This file contains the schema for all the tables.

Execute the database.sql script in your new ecommerce_db database to create the necessary tables.

Import into NetBeans

Open NetBeans and go to File > Open Project.

Navigate to the project folder you cloned and select it. NetBeans will automatically detect the project type and open it.

Configure Database Connection

In NetBeans, find the Hibernate configuration file (e.g., hibernate.cfg.xml) and update the database credentials to match your local MySQL setup (username, password, and database name).

Add the MySQL JDBC driver to the project's libraries.

Deploy the Project

Right-click the project in NetBeans.

Select Run or Clean and Build. NetBeans will build the project and deploy it to the configured Apache Tomcat server.

How to Use
Once the project is deployed, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to the local server address (e.g., http://localhost:8080/[your-project-name]).
